Learning Order

Since you’re starting from zero :

Bubble sort -> adjacent element comparison

Insertion Sort → Understand shifting elements

Merge sort -> divide and conquer

Quick Sort → Core DSA interview algorithm divide and conquer

Heap Sort → Builds heap intuition

Counting / Radix / Bucket Sort → Optional but good for linear-time sorting
